# LAB02

## **Fuel Efficiency**

Create a new Python file called **`fuel_efficiency.py`**

At the **very top of your file**, include a comment with **your name and CWID** like this:

```python
# Name: Jane Doe
# CWID: 12345678

def main():
    #TODO Get user input for miles and gallons.
    #TODO Ensure print statements are only in main.

def calc_efficiency(miles, gallons) -> (float, str):
    #TODO Calculate MPG (Miles Per Gallon)
    #TODO determine efficiency
    """
    mpg grater than or equal to 40 is "Excellent"
    mpg grater than or equal to 30 is "Good"
    mpg grater than or equal to 20 is "Average"
    mpg less than 20 is "Poor"
    """
    return mgp, rating

main()
```
## Example Output:
#### Run 1:
```text
Enter miles driven:  200
Enter gallons used:  5

Efficiency:  Excellent
MPG:  40.00
```
#### Run 2:
```text
Enter miles driven:  100
Enter gallons used:  0

Error: Gallons used cannot be zero.
```
